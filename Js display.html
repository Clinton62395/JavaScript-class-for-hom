        <h1>the Five ways to display JS Code</h1>
        <ol>
            <li> <b>console.log</b> <br>
                The console.log method is used to display messages or variables in the browser's console, which you
                can access through the developer tools (DevTools).
            </li>
            <li> <b>Alert Box:</b> <br>
                The alert method displays a message in a modal dialog box, which must be dismissed by the user
                before they can interact with the webpage again.
            </li>
            <li> <b>Document Write:</b><br>
                The document.write method writes directly to the HTML document. However, it's not recommended for
                modern web development because it can overwrite the entire document if used after the page has
                loaded.
            </li>
            <li> <b>DOM Manipulation:</b><br>
                By selecting an element in the HTML document using methods like getElementById, you can change its
                content using the innerHTML property.
            </li>
            <li> <b>Browser Console in HTML:</b> <br>
                You can also display JavaScript output in the browser's console by linking a function to an event,
                such as onload in the "body" tag.

                <p>Each method is useful in different contexts, so it's great to know various ways to display or
                    debug JavaScript code!</p>
