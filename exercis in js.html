            <h1>the Five ways to display JS Code</h1>
            <ol>
                <li> <b>console.log</b> <br>
                    The console.log method is used to display messages or variables in the browser's console, which you
                    can access through the developer tools (DevTools).
                </li>
                <li> <b>Alert Box:</b> <br>
                    The alert method displays a message in a modal dialog box, which must be dismissed by the user
                    before they can interact with the webpage again.
                </li>
                <li> <b>Document Write:</b><br>
                    The document.write method writes directly to the HTML document. However, it's not recommended for
                    modern web development because it can overwrite the entire document if used after the page has
                    loaded.
                </li>
                <li> <b>DOM Manipulation:</b><br>
                    By selecting an element in the HTML document using methods like getElementById, you can change its
                    content using the innerHTML property.
                </li>
                <li> <b>Browser Console in HTML:</b> <br>
                    You can also display JavaScript output in the browser's console by linking a function to an event,
                    such as onload in the "body" tag.

                    <p>Each method is useful in different contexts, so it's great to know various ways to display or
                        debug JavaScript code!</p>

            <h1>ten reserved JS keyword and their action</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>  <b>break:</b> <br>
                    The break statement is used to terminate a loop, switch, or label statement. When encountered, the
                    control of the program moves out of the loop.
                </li>
                <li> <b>case:</b> <br>
                    The case keyword is used in switch statements to define various possible values that switch can
                    match. If the value matches, the associated block of code is executed.
                </li>
                <li> <b>catch:</b><br>
                    The catch block is used in conjunction with try to handle exceptions. If an error occurs in the try
                    block, the catch block executes.
                </li>
                <li> <b>class:</b> <br>
                    The class keyword is used to define a class. Classes are templates for creating objects and can
                    include methods and constructors.
                </li>
                <li><b>continue: </b> <br>
                    The default keyword is used in switch statements to specify the code that should run if no case
                    matches the switch expression.
                </li>
                <li><b>delete: </b> <br>
                    The delete keyword is used to remove a property from an object.
                </li>
                <li> <b>finally:</b> <br>
                    The finally block is used in conjunction with try and catch to execute code regardless of whether an
                    error occurred or not.
                </li>
                <li> <b>function:</b><br>
                    The function keyword is used to declare a function.
                </li>
                <li><b>return: </b> <br>
                    The return statement is used to exit a function and return a value.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>These keywords are essential to understanding and writing JavaScript code effectively.</p>

            <h1>What are the differences and similarities between let, var and const?</h1>

            <p>Similarities</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <b>Variable Declaration:</b> <br> All three (let, var, const) are used to declare variables.
                </li>
                <li><b>Storing Any Data Type: </b> <br> They can store any type of data, including strings, numbers, objects,
                    arrays, etc.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Differences</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <b>let:</b> <br>
                    Has block scope. It is only accessible within the block (e.g., { ... }) it is declared.
                     <b>let:</b> Cannot be re-declared within the same scope. <br>
                </li>

                <li> <b>var:</b><br>
                    Has function scope. It is accessible anywhere within the function it is declared.
                    <b>var and let: </b>Can be assigned new values after their initial declaration. <br>
                </li>
                <li><b>const:</b> <br>
                    Has block scope, similar to let. It is only accessible within the block it is declared.
                     <b>const:</b>Cannot be re-declared within the same scope. <br>
                </li>
