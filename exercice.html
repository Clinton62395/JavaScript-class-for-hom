        //Comparison Operators
        // Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean(true or false).
        // They are used in conditions to determine the relationship between values.Common comparison
        //  operators include:

        let a = 5;
        let b = 10;

        console.log(a > b);
        console.log(a < b);

        // Logical Operators
        // Logical operators are used to combine multiple boolean expressions or conditions.
        //  They help in creating complex conditionals by combining multiple comparisons. 
        // Common logical operators include:

        let x = true;
        let y = false;

        console.log(x && y);
        console.log(x || y);
        console.log(!x);
